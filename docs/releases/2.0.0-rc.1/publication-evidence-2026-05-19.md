# ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 Publication Evidence - 2026-05-19

This is release-readiness evidence only. It does not create a GitHub release,
npm publication, plugin tag, marketplace submission, billing announcement, or
social announcement.

## Source Commit

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream main | `7a0645ed47d6a3aca54b4a214aab6dfaa58e770d` |
| Git remote | `https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC.git` |
| Evidence scope | Current `main` after PR #1990 harness-audit GitHub integration scoring, PR #1991 canonical ECC identity gate, PR #1992 release video-suite gate, and PR #1993 growth outreach pack |
| Local status caveat | `git status --short --branch` was clean after pulling `origin/main`; generated evidence files are committed after the source snapshot they describe |

The release operator must repeat all publish-facing checks from the exact final
release commit with a strictly clean checkout before publishing.

## Merge Batch

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| PR #1990 | Merged GitHub integration harness-audit scoring and conflict salvage from the earlier unsafe PR lane |
| PR #1991 | Merged canonical ECC release identity gate across README, plugin/package metadata, OpenCode surfaces, Marketplace metadata, audit defaults, quickstart, release URL ledger, naming/publication matrix, and release tests |
| PR #1992 | Merged the release video-suite gate, production manifest, validator, package file surface, preview-pack smoke wiring, release-surface tests, and compact CI JSON output |
| PR #1993 | Merged the partner, sponsor, consulting, conference, podcast, GitHub Discussion, and video CTA pack for the hypergrowth outbound lane |

## Release And Growth Evidence

| Gate | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release-surface tests | `node tests/docs/ecc2-release-surface.test.js` | 25 passed, 0 failed |
| Preview-pack smoke | `npm run preview-pack:smoke -- --format json` | Ready true; digest `3bb55807407b`; 29 required artifacts; 5 passed, 0 failed |
| Release video suite | `npm run release:video-suite -- --format json --summary` with `ECC_VIDEO_SOURCE_ROOT` and `ECC_VIDEO_RELEASE_SUITE_ROOT` | Ready true; 15/15 source assets present; 13/13 render, timeline, caption, EDL, and segment artifacts present; primary rough render is 144.759 seconds and 106.78 MB |
| Full local suite | `node tests/run-all.js` | 2544 passed, 0 failed |
| PR #1993 CI | GitHub Actions run `26093792219` | Completed successfully for `d9ac22c697d9a8a8771512ab01e6df857c16776d`; all reported checks passed, including lint, validation, security scan, coverage, GitGuardian, and the macOS/Ubuntu/Windows test matrix |
| Public-path sanitization | `node scripts/ci/validate-no-personal-paths.js` through local suite and CI | Passed |
| Markdown and whitespace | `markdownlint` focused release docs plus `git diff --check` before PR #1993 | Passed |

## Product And Positioning Evidence

| Surface | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical repo identity | Public URLs and release docs now use `https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC` where public links are needed |
| Release claim | Release notes and launch collateral frame ECC as the harness-native operator system for agentic work, not a Claude-only config pack |
| Video proof | `video-suite-production.md` gates the local rough render, timeline, captions, source inventory, self-eval, and no-private-path publication rules |
| Growth proof | `partner-sponsor-talks-pack.md` provides approval-gated copy for sponsors, partners, consulting, talks, podcasts, GitHub Discussion, and video CTAs |
| Business baseline | Hypergrowth command center and partner pack use `$1,728/mo` current MRR, `$10,000/mo` target MRR, and `$8,272/mo` gap |

## Current Publication Blockers

- GitHub prerelease `v2.0.0-rc.1` is still not created in this pass.
- npm `ecc-universal@2.0.0-rc.1` is still not published to the `next`
  dist-tag.
- Claude plugin tag and marketplace propagation remain approval-gated.
- Codex repo-marketplace distribution is verified by prior evidence, but
  official Plugin Directory publishing remains blocked on OpenAI submission or
  listing evidence.
- ECC Tools billing/native-payments copy remains blocked until a Marketplace
  Pro purchase/webhook path writes ready production billing state for a target
  Marketplace test account and the billing announcement gate passes.
- Release notes, X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, GitHub Discussion, longform copy,
  sponsor outreach, partner outreach, consulting copy, conference pitches, and
  podcast pitches still need final live URLs plus human approval before posting
  or sending.
- Discord/community links still need a real invite or bot/guild credential path
  before public docs should route users there.

## Result

The tracked public PR queue, issue queue, discussion queue, canonical ECC
identity, release video suite, preview pack, and growth outreach packet are
current on May 19, 2026 for `main` through
`7a0645ed47d6a3aca54b4a214aab6dfaa58e770d`.

This improves publication readiness but does not replace the approval-gated
release, package, plugin, billing, Discord, and announcement steps in
`publication-readiness.md`.
